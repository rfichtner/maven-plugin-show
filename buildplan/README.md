# Buildplan

List the plugin executions (and see version numbers)
    `mvn buildplan:list`  

Better overview with (without versions numbers)
    `mvn buildplan:list-phase`  

Add a plugin to the build and see where it shows up
    `mvn buildplan:list-phase`  

If the plugin does not show up add a phase for the execution
    `mvn buildplan:list-phase`
